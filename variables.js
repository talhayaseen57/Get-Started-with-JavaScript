Rules for varaible names in JavaScript:
- vaiarbles are case sensitive.
- vaiarbles can contain only alphabets, digits, underscore (_) and $ character.
- only alphabets, underscore (_) and $ character can be first character.
- reserved keywords can not be a varaible name.
- (optional) for best practice use camel-case naming convention.
